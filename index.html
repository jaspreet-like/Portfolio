        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="txt">I am a pre-final year student at <strong>IIT Kanpur</strong> pursuing integrated BS-MS in <strong>Mathematics and Scientific Computing.</strong> My technical 
          interest lies in <strong>Competitive Programming</strong> and <strong>Statistics.</strong> Apart from it, I'm inclined towards sports, in particular soccer. 
          I'm a foodie who loves travelling. If you are like-minded and want to escapade someday, count me in! Kudos :)</p>

          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>I started programming about two years ago. Starting with 'Data Structures & Algorithms', I found my interest for solving coding questions revolving around 
            DSA and started taking part in competitive programming contests. I found the contest questions more like puzzles/problems which were usually asked in math
            olympiads during my high school. And, I loved solving those questions. I started appreciating the mathematics behind the algorithms from where my interest went
            onto computational mathematics and then onto statistics. Cut to today, I'm doing courses on Statistical Inference and also working for my research project on 
            detecting fraudulent behaviour in UPI-based transactions. I majorly code in C++ for competitive programming and use R for developing statistical models related 
            to my master's project. Apart from these, I've also worked on C, Python, Matlab/Octave, Javascript and Latex. So, if you have some cool opportunities/projects
            where you think my skills could be useful, feel free to contact me :)

          <h3>Soccer</h3>
          <p>I started playing soccer at the age of 13 in my school. Almost instantly, I was in love with the game. By 16, I was playing in nearby tournaments
            as well as local college sports festivals. I had to take a break from soccer for two years, else today I would've been a professional soccer player :) 
            I resumed playing in my college under the guidance of coach Mr. Sunil Kumar. Our college team participated in numerous tournaments, most competitive 
            among it being Inter-IIT Sports Meet. I was in my third year when Covid struck and had to come back to my hometown Patiala. Again, my professional career 
            in soccer was put to rest :p If you live nearby and are interested in playing soccer matches, feel free to contact me.</p>
